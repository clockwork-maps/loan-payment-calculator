# Loan Payment Calculator
This project lets a user input values for an initial amount, an interest rate, and an amortization factor and then recieve the total cost and number of payment intervals needed based on a range of procedurally generated payments. Calcuations assume interest is added to loan _after_ payment cycle, though I could possibly add a checkbox or toggle to option assuming interest added before payments are subtracted from the loan. I'm not an accountant, so forgive me if the assumption is wrong before I get around to fixing it.

Got some of the main features working. Currently going to pause a bit until I have more time to figure out how to get d3 playing nicely with TS and lit element to set up the graphical representation of the loan cost/interval/payment calculations. When that's done I'll set up mobile and print formatting, (again, __possibly__) the interest option toggle, and then be done. Wanted to get some experience with lit element and it's done pretty well in that regard.
